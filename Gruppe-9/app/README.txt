How to run program:
The program can be found with the url https://xdit-4ed75.web.app

Should this for some reason not work, you can open a command-line in the /app/ folder, and host a private server
This can be done with fx Node.js with the command 'npx http-server'
If you choose this approach, it is critical that you access the live-server through your localhost
Firebase will only work with that URL.
A server hosted with node.js will tell you to connect to http://127.0.0.1:8080
However you need to connect to localhost:8080
